<h2>HOW IT WORKS</h2>
<p>Through exercising, consuming protein and staying commited, you will lose most of your excess fat while retaining enough to look fit!</p>

<h2>TRY IT NOW!</h2>
<p>FIRST METHOD GOES HERE!!!!</p>
<p>OR... simply go out for a jog, every day. Jog around the neighbourhood, preferably with a friend or family member, to help encourage you when the going gets tough! Make sure to also have a journal on hand, so you can record your progress - photos also help too, so you can look back when you're nice and fit and thin in the future and think about how far you've come!</p>
